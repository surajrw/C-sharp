Polymorphism and Overriding Methods :-
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Inheritance lets us inherit fields and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

class vehicle
    {
        public void honk()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("tutt putt");
        }
    }
    class car:vehicle
    {
        public void honk()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("hurr hurr");
        }
    }
    class truck:vehicle
    {
        public void honk()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("durr durr");
        }
    }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        vehicle myvehicle=new vehicle();
        vehicle mycar=new car();
        vehicle mytruck=new truck();
        
        myvehicle.honk();
        mycar.honk();
        mytruck.honk();
    }
